# Introduction:
AnyaPath is made with Python (Pygame). In which Anya Forger from Spy x Family will find out any word that you have in mind without any mistakes. (If you don't get the right result, then you must have given an incorrect input.)

# How to play:
* Anya will ask you to **provide the length (the number of letters)** of the word you have in mind.
* Anya will give you a **matrix** which contains all **alphabets**.
* For every letter of your word, You'll have to tell Anya which **column** has the **letter** in it. Just type the column number and click **'OK'** button to move on to the next letter.

* Anya will give you an **another matrix** which is different from the previous one, and you'll have to do the **same thing again** for the last time.

* In the end Anya will tell you the name you were thinking of :D

# How it works:
